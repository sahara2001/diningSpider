# NickScrape.rb
# Nick Kurtz's attempt at/version of a basic web scraper to get acquainted with using the given gems and web scraping in general
# dependencies and commands to get them:
# gem install kimurai
# sudo apt-get install phantomjs
# created 2/10 by Nick Kurtz

require 'kimurai'


# created 2/10 by Nick Kurtz - initialize and scrape_site functions outlined
# edited 2/11 by Nick Kurtz - scrape_site method fleshed out more
# 2/11 - complete overhaul to the kimurai gem, which seems to package as many web-scraping gems as possible into one. This swap was done so we can look at js-gnerated content, which apparently Nokogiri and Mechanize cannot do.
